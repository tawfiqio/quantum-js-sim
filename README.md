# Quantum-js-sim

A lightweight **Quantum Computer Simulator** written in JavaScript â€” simulating qubits, quantum gates, superposition, and measurement, all running in your browser or Node.js.  

Perfect for learning quantum computing basics, experimenting with quantum algorithms, or just flexing your quantum nerd muscles.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Represent qubits as complex 2D vectors (Î±|0âŸ© + Î²|1âŸ©)  
- Apply quantum gates (Hadamard, Pauli-X, Pauli-Z, CNOT) as matrix multiplications  
- Measure qubits to probabilistically collapse their state  
- Support for multi-qubit states via tensor products (planned/expandable)  
- Simple, modular, and extensible codebase written in clean JavaScript  
- No dependencies! Pure JS math with custom complex number and matrix ops
